# Mandelbrot_Cantor-Dust_fractals

In this small project I have tried and implemented the Cantor-Dust fractal first, then afterwards the tougher one, the Mandelbrotset.

Here are some descriptions regarding both fractals:

Cantor Dust: 
The Cantor dust fractal is generated by starting with a black square.
In each iteration you split the square into four parts, thus creating clusters of
”dust” which can be used to model white noise on telephony lines. you will eventually 
end up with a large amount of uniformly distributed dots, or ”Cantor dust”. 
The dots represents short periods of time where there is disturbance on the communication line.


Mandelbrotset:
the Mandelbrot set is a set of points in the complex plane.
The complex plane is a two-dimensional space with the a vertical imaginary
axis, and a horizontal real axis. A point in the plane can be described using
a complex number c ∈ C. Here we have an IFS with the recursive formula zn+1 = zn + c and an
initial value of z0 = 0. In each loop, you square the previous number and seed
the result with the value of c. The vertical brackets denotes the Euclidean
norm, which is a measurement of how far away a point in the plane is from
origo, ||z|| = √a2 + √b2. A point c belongs to the Mandelbrot set if it remains
bounded when we run the formula in a feedback loop.
